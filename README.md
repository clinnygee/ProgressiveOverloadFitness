## Reflection

  - University project that I went a little bit too far with - I was having fun!
  - I originally set out to build just an application, where somebody could enter the stats for their workout.
  - Slowly evolved after seeing applications like strong - where i thought this could be bigger and better
  - Had some obstacles learning Android development - my first major project on the platform, and first time building something large using OOP.
  - Utilized Room for the ORM - for the frontend it was primarily android components - and some open source libraries.
